# BMW E30 3D Reproduction Parts

This repository contains a collection of 3D models for discontinued or hard-to-find BMW E30 components, recreated from original parts to support restoration and maintenance efforts.

All models are designed to be faithful, functional reproductions of their original counterparts. In some cases, the original part designs may have been slightly modified to aid in manufacturibility or to improve durability.
They are intended for **personal, non-commercial use** by enthusiasts who wish to repair or preserve their vehicles.

## Manufacturing Notes

Most of these models are not suitable for FDM printing. Since these are models of originally injection-moulded parts, they often contain fine details and mechanical features that FDM will struggle to reproduce.

The recommended manufacturing method for these parts is HP Multi Jet Fusion (MJF). This is a printing process that is available through many professional 3D printing services. The quality and mechanical properties of prints produced with MJF comes very close to injection moulding, while remaining relatively affordable.

The material used in the MJF process is nylon, with two main variants suitable for different purposes:

- **PA12**: High stiffness, strength, and chemical resistance. A good all-around material.

- **PA11**: Slightly more flexible and impact-resistant, better suited for parts that require some elasticity.

In the file name of each part, I indicate the recommended material variant. As a rule of thumb, if a part contains a snapfit feature, it should most likely be produced with the PA11 material variant. Otherwise, PA12 is the default material choice.

Many printing services offer optional post-processing to modify *surface* appearance and functionality. Depending on the service, this may include dyeing, vapor smoothing, or coating treatments.

MJF inherently produces a slightly powdery/textured surface finish, which closely resembles the appearance of the original interior plastics in the E30. This surface finish is typically smooth enough for parts with sliding fits, so in most cases, additional surface-finishing post-processing is not necessary and may even be undesirable.

On the other hand, the natural color of the MJF nylons is a white or grey, while almost all exposed plastics in the E30 are black. Fortunately, most printing services offer a black dye option for a small fee, or sometimes even at no additional cost.
