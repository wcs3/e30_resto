# BMW E30 Reproduction Parts

This repository contains a collection of 3D models, schematics, and guides for reproducing discontinued or hard-to-find BMW E30 parts.

The models and schematics strive to be faithful, functional reproductions of their original counterparts. In some cases, the original designs may have been slightly modified to aid in manufacturibility or to improve durability.
All information and files in this repo are intended for **personal, non-commercial use**.

## Manufacturing Notes

### 3D Printing
Most of the 3D models in this repo are not recommended to be produced with FDM printing. Since these are models of originally injection-moulded parts, they often contain fine details and mechanical features that FDM will struggle to reproduce.

The recommended manufacturing method for the plastic parts is HP Multi Jet Fusion (MJF). This is a printing process that is available through many professional 3D printing services. The quality and mechanical properties of prints produced with MJF comes very close to injection moulding, while remaining relatively affordable.

The material used in the MJF process is nylon, with two main variants suitable for different purposes:

- **PA12**: High stiffness, strength, and chemical resistance. A good all-around material.

- **PA11**: Slightly more flexible and impact-resistant, better suited for parts that require some elasticity.

As a rule of thumb, if a part contains a snapfit feature, it should most likely be produced with the PA11 material variant. Otherwise, PA12 is the default material choice.

Many printing services offer optional post-processing to modify surface appearance and functionality. Depending on the service, this may include dyeing, vapor smoothing, or coating treatments.

MJF inherently produces a slightly powdery/textured surface finish, which closely resembles that surface finish of the E30's exposed interior plastics. This surface finish is typically smooth enough for parts with sliding fits, so in most cases, additional surface-finishing post-processing is not necessary and may even be undesirable.

On the other hand, the natural color of the MJF nylons is a white or grey, while almost all exposed plastics in the E30 are black. Fortunately, most printing services offer a black dye option for a small fee, or sometimes even at no additional cost.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If youâ€™ve recreated, refined, or improved any E30 parts, feel free to share your work so the community can benefit. Before submitting, please ensure that:

- Your model has been test-fitted or verified for dimensional accuracy and function.
- You provide details on how to produce and assemble the model in a short note or README entry.

You can contribute by opening a pull request or starting a discussion about the part you'd like to add.
