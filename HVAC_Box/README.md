# HVAC Box Restoration

## Plastic Part Reproductions

This folder contains parts found in the HVAC Box of air-conditioning equipped E30s. Some parts may also be applicable to heater-only E30s.

### Recirculation Flaps Notes
Interior side recirculation flaps are commonly found broken around the ball joint. The provided design is strengthened in that area.

The original design has a nonreusable 6mm *riveted* ball stud. We replace this with an off the shelf *threaded* ball stud used in RC car suspension applications, fixed from behind with an M3 nut.
These threaded ball studs can be found at some RC part stores, or [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005008962197158.html).

## Sealing Material

Original foam seals in the HVAC Box of any E30 are almost guaranteed to have completely perished at this point in time. In particular, the foam on the air flaps and the open-cell foam gasket that seals the box to the dash ducting tend to crumble into dust. 

There are no replacements available for the air flap foams, but it is generally recommended to reconstruct those with 3mm or 1/8" adhesive backed neoprene. Neoprene is very durable and has much better environmental resistance than whatever foam was originally used. The replacement foam should be fitted with a 1-2mm overhang to ensure a good seal. The gasket profiles can be cut directly from a foam sheet, or pieced together with 1/2" wide tape.

The ducting gasket is still available from BMW (64111370937), but if that becomes NLA or prohibitively expensive, a possible alternative is to piece it together from strips of open-cell foam tape, approximately 3/4" wide and 1/2" thick.

The seams between the large housing parts of the box are sealed with an oring cord type of gasket. A part exists for the seal between the lower and upper housing (64111372637), but this is NLA. These can be replaced with 2mm oring cord of the appropriate rubber material (EPDM might be a good choice), or a bead of silicone.
